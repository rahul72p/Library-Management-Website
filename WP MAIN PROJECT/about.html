<p>THE STUDY CENTER  LIBRARY has been educating young people since 1999. We are one of the foremost public  library in the country, with an enviable reputation for academic achievement and breadth of extra-curricular opportunities.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide a first class all-round education, combining stunning traditional surroundings with a dynamic and modern co-educational context.</p>
<p> Our passion is education in the broadest sense of the word; we aim to promote genuine personal enquiry and intellectual appetite, to provide each pupil with innumerable opportunities for success and to ensure they leave with good education.</p>
<p>verything we do is designed to encourage, stimulate, and inspire young people. We strive to mould Cheltonians into individuals who are confident and enquiring without being arrogant. We pride ourselves in our pupils' tolerance, their respectfulness and above all, their ability to contribute positively to society and our increasingly global community. Pupils leave us with excellent qualifications which enable entry into top UK or US universities but more than that, they leave us with the skills they need to succeed in life. They leave with exciting futures.<p>
<p>The academic life of student is guided by two key principles:</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>to educate pupils to know as broadly and to think as independently and incisively as possible,
</li>
<hr>
<li>to achieve the best possible exam results for each pupil.
